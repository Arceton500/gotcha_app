An automated system to manage the yearly game of the lifeguards of Saint-Hyacinthe.
After seeing the mess that was managing the point system and who is dead/who isn't, the idea to automate the work of the organizers came to mind.

## This project will encompass a few things:
```
A way to create an account/profile
An automatic point system.
A method to verify if someone is dead or not (a list of the current status of players, and a button to "kill" someone).
A comprehenesible ui for the organisers to manage well the game. (aka, give/take points, revive/kill players, etc)

MAYBE:
A minimap for some of the big final events.
```
